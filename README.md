# Storefront - Virtual Store
# LAB 37 - Redux - Combined Reducers

**Virtual Store Phase 2:** breaking up the store into multiple reducers and sharing functionality/data between components


## Phase 2 Requirements

In phase 2, we will be adding the “Add to Cart” feature to our application, which will allow our users to not only browse items in the store, but also select them and have them persist in their “shopping cart” for later purchase.  

The following user stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project:

- As a user, I want to choose from products in the list and add them to my shopping cart
- As a user, I want to see the products that I’ve added to my shopping cart so that
- As a user, I want to change the quantity of items I intend to purchase in my shopping cart
- As a user, I want to be able to remove an item from my shopping cart

## Setup/Run 

- clone the app repo
- move into `store-app` deirctory => `cd store-app`
- install the dependencies => `npm i`
- run the app => `npm run start`
