# Storefront - Virtual Store
# LAB 38 - Redux - Asynchronous Actions

**Virtual Store Phase 3:** Connect the Virtual Store to an API to retrieve live data from your data source, using `thunk` to enable asynchronous actions


## Phase 3 Requirements

In phase 3, we will be connecting our Virtual Store to a live API so that our data is persistent and able to be separately managed.  

The following user stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project:

- As a user, I want to interact with live inventory so that I have confidence that the displayed products are in stock
- As a user, I want to know to that when I add an item to my cart, that it is removed from inventory so that no other users can purchase it


## Setup/Run 

- clone the app repo
- move into `store-app` deirctory => `cd store-app`
- install the dependencies => `npm i`
- run the app => `npm run start`
